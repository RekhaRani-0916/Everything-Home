## About the project

This is my <strong>10<sup>th</sup></strong> Frontend Mentor challenge.

This is my solution to the E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor. The goal of this challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the [design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohamedAridah/frontendmentor_e-commerce-product-page/main/design/desktop-preview.jpg) as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## Built with

For this project i used:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## What i learned

This challenge was very tough. it contains alot of small details i should take care of. I tried to make my solution simple as possible. The good thing about this challenge that i 've learned alot from it. you can see live website from the links above.‚òù

## What you can do?!

I need your opinions, feedbacks , how do you find my code structure? or any suggestions i can do to make my projects better. Also if you guys like my content, follow me this makes me happy‚ù§üëç.

## Useful resources

- **Adobe Xd** - I use adobe xd to check the size of elements.

## Acknowledgments

- I don't have sketch or figma files. So the final result isn't pixel perfect.
- I want to say **Thanks** to anyone who see my work and react with it, give me his feedback and helped me to improve myself. So thank you‚ù§.
